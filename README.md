# !!! Welcome to DeepOVel - Deep Object Velocity in Video !!!
This tool was developed as part of my capstone project for the UC San Diego Extension Machine Learning Engineering Bootcamp.
The tool aims to find the velocity of objects within a video using Deep Learning algorithms.

I would like to acknowledge the following resources used in this project. A lot of the core python code was taken from the following repositories:

## Dataset used to evaluate the model:
The main page for the dataset used is located here: https://viratdata.org/
